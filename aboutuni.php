<p style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%;">  With the commencement of the academic session 2015-16, the University has put a check on its 
  quantitative growth; the cases of additional intake in existing programme/s and grant of affiliation to 
  new institutions are examined quite stringently. Even so, it is open to start new academic programmes 
  in case it is likely to augment the supply of trained manpower for the so far neglected socio-economic 
  sector(s)/segments of population. </p>
<p style="padding-left:10%;padding-right:10%;"><strong>RULES &amp; REGULATIONS</strong></p>

  significance, within the provisions of the University Act, rules and regulations (Statutes &amp; Ordinances) framed 
  thereunder. The University has notified 33 Statutes and 30 Ordinances which have not only been published 
  in the Gazette of Delhi but have also been laid on the floor of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi. The University 
  Act and all its Statutes as well as Ordinances have been placed on the University Website. This clearly speaks 
  of the nature of transparency maintained by the University Administration in its functioning keeping the society 
at large informed not only about the academic programmes but also about all its latest rules, regulations etc.</p>
