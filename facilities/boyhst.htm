University
has opened a hostel for boys to provide students the conducive ambience for
learning &amp; leading a balance life. While all the regular students of GGSIPU
are eligible for hostel accommodation, preference will be given to outside Delhi
students. The hostel has given students a platform to interact after hectic
college hours. The students also get the benefit of accessing the university
information resources centre and university laboratories to maximum, which would
have been spend commuting concurrently. A cooperative mess, run by the students,
provides inmates to decide among themselves the kind of food that suits their
appetite. Proper attention is given for the hygiene and cleanliness of the
hostel, and all the residents are expected to keep their rooms neat and tidy. A
back-up generator is also provided for round the clock power supply.</div></span></p>
