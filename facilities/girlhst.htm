<p align=justify> The University has recently opened a hostel for girls which 
  provides excellent residential facilities . It is located in the campus and 
  is open for all categories of students , but the preference is given to the 
  outside Delhi students.</p>
<p align=justify>

The University charges the students 
a very nominal fees for this Hostel facility and provides all of them with 
extremely comfortable and safe rooms. This newly provided hostel Facility has 
not only helped the girls of The University to inter mingle among each other in 
a better way but has also given them a chance to access the University Library 
and Laboratories for a longer period of time. This Hostel has been a great 
comfort to outside Delhi girls as a large part of there day after University was 
otherwise spend in commuting.   The Hostel mess is run by students. The food 
charges depend upon the number of students residing in the hostel and is 
collected by the hostel management committee.</p>
<p align=justify><strong>Note: <em>Hostel will be available only to the bonafide students of University School of Studies and IGIT </em></strong></p>
