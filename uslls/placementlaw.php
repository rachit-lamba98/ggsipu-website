actively interning in the institutions and establishments that suit their 
desired profiles. Some of them have excellent corporate law profiles, doing 
internships with the leading law firms in India. Those who wish to pursue 
litigation as their career choice have undertaken apprenticeship under reputed 
litigation lawyers and judges. Some with social awareness about the challenges 
in front of their society have worked with human rights organizations, legal 
service authorities and women commissions. Our biggest asset is a strong alumni 
base in the various areas of law and the placement and internship cell of the 
school has been reaching out to them, receiving a positive and enthusiastic 
response from the pass out batches. This connection with the alumni is the 
lifeline of our students, simultaneously encouraging and motivating them</span><p>
