	  <p>USEM has state of the art laboratories for carrying out teaching and research. USEM boasts of having an advanced instrumentation system lab, water quality analysis laboratory, remote sensing / GIS laboratory, environment microbial technology laboratory, Energy and Climate Change, air pollution monitoring laboratory, biosystematics and conservation biology lab. </p>
<p><strong>Research/Teaching Laboratory</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Advanced Instrumentation System Laboratory </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lab houses the latest and sophisticated instruments namely, Gas Liquid chromatograph (GLC), High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC), UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS), CHNSO Analyzer, Microbial Identification System, Mass Detection System, Automatic Titrator, Flame Photometer etc. </p>
<p><em><strong>Water Quality Analysis Laboratory </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Physico-chemical parameters of water are analyzed in this laboratory. Special emphasis is given on learning treatment techniques for public water supply and domestic and industrial effluents. Water quality analysis laboratory is the hub of teaching and research in the school. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Geomatics Laboratory </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>School has among the best equipped facilities for carrying out research in the area of bioresources and environment using geospatial techniques. Geomatics lab has remote sensing and GIS software's like ERDAS 2010, Arc GIS, Arc View, Geo Media, ENVI, SARSCPAE etc. which not only cater to the needs of M.Sc. students but also research needs of the Ph. D. scholars. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<em>NRM and Conservation Biology Laboratory</em></strong></p>
<p>Natural Resource Management and Conservation Laboratory take interest in the subject area of Forest Ecology, Agro-Ecosystem, Urban Green Space, Biodiversity, Wildlife, NTFP and certification issues. Policy and governance aspect also in the priority area. Experiments are largely field based exercise, in interdisciplinary approach given priority in the Laboratory to solve practical problems of society. </p>
<p><em><strong>Environment Microbial Technology Laboratory </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Environmental Microbial Technology Lab with facilities like Laminar Air Flow, BOD Incubator, incubator shakers, centrifuge, autoclave, microscopes, colony counter etc. is providing knowledge of microbial world and their use in bioremediation. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<em>Energy &amp; Air Pollution Monitoring Laboratory </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Energy and Air Pollution monitoring laboratory has latest and sophisticated instruments like High Volume sampler, Bomb Calorie Meter, Sound Level Meter etc. Experiments in this lab are performed on sampling, analysis, measurement and monitoring of air and noise pollution. The lab has recently acquired sensor based instrument for analysis of green house gases and aerosols. </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;<em>Biosystematics Laboratory </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Biosystematics lab has all the latest instruments like gel-doc, PCR, fluorescence microscope and software required in the fields of systematics, phylogenetics and web designing. </p>
<p><em><strong>Biodiversity and Conservation Laboratory </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Biodiversity and Conservation lab has all the latest instruments like gel-doc, PCR, fluorescence microscope and software required in the fields of systematics, phylogenetics and web designing. In addition to the teaching labs, there are labs dedicated to the research in the specified fields. </p>
