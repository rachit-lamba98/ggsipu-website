								<h2>Interview with Shilpi Nanda</h2>
								<p> Anukriti Jain </p>
							</header>
							<p align="justify">
								<b>Ques.</b> I would like to congratulate you on getting selected in Cambridge and Oxford to pursue your masters in law. It is really great to see someone from USS achieve such pinnacle of success. How were you able to manage your admission procedure as it is a tedious task to apply in these institutions? What would your advice be to the students who aspire to be a part of these top notch universities? What kind of internships, recommendations do they need to get selected?
								<br> Firstly, thank you so much for your warm wishes. I definitely agree with you that applying to Oxbridge universities is a tedious task as it takes almost a year to complete the same. My advice to anyone planning to do the same is to get all the documents ready well ahead of time. Both the Universities only accept applicants who are in the top five percent of their respective universities. For University of Cambridge specifically, you are required to fill an extensive form with questions mostly on the reasons for the masters programme. Along with the same, they require a CV, and two letter of recommendations from professors who have taught the applicant. On the other hand, University of Oxford selection is primarily based on an essay along with three letter of recommendations. The deadline for Cambridge is as early as November of the preceding academic year of admission, where as for Oxfordâ€™s the deadline is in January. I would highly recommend all applicants to be well aware of all the deadlines and requirements of the programme only via the official website of these universities.
								<br> Managing my applications for University of Oxford and Cambridge was not easy. These have been my dream universities and due to the extremely competitive nature of applications, I wasn't sure about getting through. I had also applied to other UK universities like London School of Economics and Kings College of London which in time were also successful. The key to cracking any of these top notch universities is to be dedicated and systematic in your applications. For the longest of time, I remember having a long to do list and checking things off as I finished them. I am thankful to be surrounded by supportive friends and family who had continuously re-read my essay and statement of purpose before I had sent them out. I recommend all applicants to make at least twenty drafts of each document before they submit the same to these universities.
								<br> What I learnt while editing my CV was that it is essential to convince the universities that you are fit for that specific programme. Therefore, if I am applying for a corporate finance programme, I must make sure that even my internships at law firms are within areas of similar direction. So, the internships or even the research papers only hold value if they are in furtherance of the course being applied to. The letter of recommendations must be taken from professors who are willing to help you and are well aware of your future plans, so as to reflect your vision accurately in their letters.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Ques.</b> You have been featured as the cosmopolitan cover girl and you are regular with your magazine shoots, how do you manage your time, being highly devoted towards your studies?
								<br> Although I am academically oriented, I dont like being one track. When I was a little girl, my mother put me in every activity possible and I enjoyed doing a lot at once. I remember even at the age of eight, I was learning martial arts, classical hindustani vocals and acing my class at the same time. As for magazine shoots, I thoroughly enjoy doing them, as they make me feel confident and beautiful as a person. Every simple shoot is about eight to ten hours long, and is extremely gruelling to my body, specially if it is a ballet shoot. So it becomes imperative for me to make the most of the remaining hours of my day. I squeeze in shoots during relatively less stressful time of the year, so that my studies do not suffer. As I have several passions that are way beyond the legal world, for me being unproductive is just not an option.
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Ques.</b> What has really inspired you to keep your passion for ballet alive, never giving up and excelling in it?
								<br> I have been dancing various forms for several years now. But it was only about five years ago that I started learning Russian Vaganova ballet from my teacher, Mr. Fernando Aguilera, at the Imperial Fernando Ballet Company. Ballet brings me peace and strength. Even if I had a long rough day, it brings me relief. I have been meticulously trained over the years amongst other ballerinas to challenge my body and mind into learning this beautiful art form. I feel as if the art form has sharpened my thinking and concentration power. We dance only on piano music on wooden halls, and the feeling is just spectacular. I haven't even thrown away my first pair of ballet pointed shoes till date. I intend to keep learning ballet even during my masters in UK.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Ques.</b> How do you think USLLS has contributed towards your success, how has it helped you nurture yourself in these 5 years?
								<br> USLLS, has been by home for the past five years. It was specially during my application process for LLM Programmes abroad that I realised the support that I received from my college. The faculty was more than helpful in offering letter of recommendations, and advice on future course prospects. My professors were supportive and excited for my career visions, making them a strong back bone to fall upon. Since my first year, I have seen the college grow tremendously. As the college runs on a double semester programme, students have enough breathing space to pursue more than just academics. I strongly believe this is golden, as most law schools are not able to provide this opportunity to excel both in academic as well as non academic fields.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Ques.</b> You inspire everyone with the multitude of passions you have and how brilliantly you have excelled in every sphere. What would be your message for the readers of ConnectUSS who think of achieving a similar feat and tips to manage their time?
								<br> I think its important for all of us to find something which makes us stand out of the crowd, or else everyone would be just graduating with the same degree in hand. Everyone needs to introspect, and set there own individual goals besides completing the law degree alone. The minute our goals are clear, managing time automatically becomes much easier.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Ques.</b> Lastly, where do you see yourself in next 10 years?
								<br> In the next 10 years, I hopefully see my self as a successful trans-national corporate lawyer specialising in the field of commercial laws. After years of experience, I plan to open my own top corporate law firm, and lead Indiaâ€™s gateways to development in commercial laws on a global level.
