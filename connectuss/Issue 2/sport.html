								<p>The 10 km race is a long distance road running competition that tests the stamina and endurance of participants. Also referred to as the 10K race, or simply 10K, it is one of the most common types of road running events, alongside the half marathon and marathon. It is usually distinguished from the 10,000 metres track running by stating the distance in kilometres, rather than metres.
								</p>
								<p>As one of the shortest common road distances, many 10K races attract a high level of participation. Even the 10 km Race Event held during the Sports Meet had many enthusiiastic runners participating. The popularity of the 10K race was due to the fact that the distance is long enough to represent a challenge to the participants, but short enough to remain accessible for an untrained runner. The 10K event is an annual fixture of the Universityâ€™s Sports Meet as a way of promoting physical fitness among students. This year, Sandeep from TIPS, Anuj Kumar from ACMS and Rohit Kumar Pandey from C-DAC held the top three positions.</p>

								<p>The participants, volunteers, staff and supporters witnessed a very exciting yet, tough match of Volleyball, played in the grounds of GGSIPU. The University hosted its 11th Annual Sports Meet from 13th to 15th November, 2014. During this 3 day event, a lot of sports were played with utmost sportsmanship and so was volleyball. The matches began a couple of months before the main event. Only the finals for both the categories (Men and Women) were held on the second day of the meet. The first match scheduled for the day was Volleyball (women) which was played between the teams from USS and NIEC. Though USS lost the match, the game was played equally well from both sides. But as there could only be one winner, one of the teams had to lose.</p>
								<p>In the menâ€™s category, USS took its revenge by winning the match played against NIEC. The crowd applauded and cheered for their favorite teams. The pressure to win was high on both sides, and one could clearly see how badly both teams wanted to win. Both the teams gave their best till the last minute of the match, and USS emerged victorious with a well deserved victory.</p>
								<p>â€œIt was great winning the title. The other team played quite well too; it was a tough competition but we had to win the game at any costâ€, said Krishan Pratap, of the USS team.</p>

								<p>The Directorate of Studentsâ€™ Welfare of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University organized the 11th Annual Sports Meet 2014, which was held from 13th to 15th November 2014. Chess is described as a science, an art and a sport. It has the virtue of being completely free of the element of luck, that is, the result of each game depends entirely upon the skill of the players. And this skill was found in abundance in the enthusiastic participants from various colleges. Around 200 players participated in the knock out rounds. Ritesh and Nancy stood first in men and womenâ€™s category respectively defeating the previous yearâ€™s winners. Apart from the players that participated, there was a dedicated team of coordinators who volunteered for the first time but did an appreciative work. The sports meet was a successful event with a cheerful audience that energized the players.

								<p>Table tennis is the most popular indoor sport in the world. It is a sport which anyone can enjoy irrespective of their age and attributes. Though as a viewer, it seems to be quite a simple game, but while playing you realise that it is one of the hardest and most physically demanding of all sports. The event was held on the second and third days of the 11th Annual Sports Meet. 16 participants registered for the menâ€™s singles category, with 10 teams taking part in the doubles category. While 12 participants played in the womenâ€™s singles category.</p>
								<p>The top three positions in T.T. Singles Men were bagged by Annchit Khanna from HMRITM, Abhishek from JIMS Kalkaji and Varun from JIMS Vasant Kunj, respectively. Kaushal Malik-Bhavya Bhardwaj from MSI, Vivek-Surajit Mandal from Amity and Rohan Tyagi-Aviral Kazara were the respective winners of T.T. Doubles Men. Raashi Sharma won the gold in the womenâ€™s category with Anjali Gambhir from ISIC coming second and Barkha coming third.</p>
								<p>On bagging the title Raashi said, â€œI feel that I am in peak condition, but I am grounded at this moment. There is a lot more to achieve after this.â€ All the participants showed true sportsmanship. The team which lost took their loss well and said, â€œAny game is all about winning and losing. If one team wins then other has to lose. But never mind, there is always next time.â€</p>
