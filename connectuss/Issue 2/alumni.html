								<p align="justify">In this edition of alumni dairies, we bring to you Anubhav Jain, a visionary ex student of our University. Holder of the Limca Book of Records for the novel with the most number of co-authors and one of the speakers at TEDxUSICT, his life can be aptly portrayed in Woodrow Wilson's famous quote.
									<br>
									<b>" You are not here merely to make a living, you are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand."<b></b></b>
									<br>
									<br>Anubhav jain current leads one of the most comprehensive and easy to use company specific recruitment platform called StudyBud. He has addressed more than one lakh students on life skills and his passion to reach out to as many people as possible has transformed into an online platform as he continues his journey. The following interaction took place between him and our representative.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Ques.</b> When did you realize that you wanted to train people on life skills?
									<br>
									<b>Ans.</b> When I was studying in B-school in IIM indore, I found that a lot of people did not know about basic life skills like table manners etc. So in 2009, I decided to start working in this sector.
									<br>
									<br><b>Ques.</b> What was the inspiration for the idea that led you to become a Limca Book of Records holder?
									<br>
									<b>Ans.</b> I am very fascinated by literature and have always wanted to write a book but don't have the patience to do so. This got me thinking and i had an idea of including multiple people. So, I created an online platform inviting people to write a book. Two thousand people responded out of which 250 were meaningful contributors and they helped pave the path to the Limca Book of Records.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Ques.</b> When you get up everyday, how do you inspire yourself and channelize your energy to achieve more?
									<br>
									<b>Ans.</b> My basic aim is the satisfaction of students and customers in the education startup. I try to respond to as many people as possible on the online forums and would like to reach out to more number of people.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Ques.</b> How do you think USICT has contributed towards your success?
									<br>
									<b>Ans.</b> USICT was the platform where it all started. That was where all my friends and the different ventures completely built me. All the faculty members inspired me to work harder and encouraged me to train, mentor and do some reasearch driven study. Experiences at USICT have enabled me to achieve a place in this world.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Ques.</b> What message would you like to give to the students of USS
									<br>
									<b>Ans.</b> I would like to sum up my message in a single line that one should trust his instincts, follow guidance and do whatever he feels is right for him.
