								As the IP university opens its gates for the new spirits for the new session, freshers's party is one of the most awaited events that every 1st year student looks forward to. It was 15th september that the HT City was welcomed to the campus of IP university for the fresher's party organised by them with the name "Fresh on Campus" powered by Alto k10 and their fashion partners Wooplr. The Master of the Ceremony was very talented Gitesh Singh, who was supposedly the best anchor an event like this could have.
								<br>
								<br> The event was divided into three parts namely a ramp walk followed by introductions and the last talent round.
								<br>
								<br> The event started off with the DJ session, where all the students from the university shaked their legs on the dhinchak tracks played by DJ Naveen. Although the event took place late in the afternoon, but nothing could stop the university crowd from grooving on the songs played by the DJ.
								<br>
								<br>After the DJ session, the main event started. All the fresher girls were asked to dance and out of them 22 girls were selected by the jury, which included Aditya and Yashashvi from the HT editorial team. These girls were made to walk the ramp along with a quick introduction round, out of which only 9 girls.could make up to the talent round. Boys were too selected with the same procedure as well.
								<br>
								<br> Before the guys could showcase their talent, DJ Sumit Sethi performed for the crowd on a track composed and sung by himself for the hollywood film Transporters. After DJ Sumit's performance, guys were all set to rock the stage and entertain the crowd with their talents
								<br>
								<br>After the talent round, it was time for the results to be announced. Amongst girls Dolkar and amongst boys Vanshul were announced as Miss and Mr freshers of the "Fresh in Campus". Along with Mr and Miss freshers there were a few other titles which were given by the organisers. Mr and Miss Chaser won by Ashu and Smriti respectively and The Gang Selfie was won by Smriti, Rakshan, Dolkar and Surbhi.
(Plz suggest smthng to replace this.)
								<br>
								<br>It was the first time that IP University have had such an event for the freshers and this whole experience was quite refreshing and energising for all the students. They look forward to more such event
