									<br> â€œA leader has the vision and the conviction that a dream can be achieved. He inspires the power and energy to get it done.â€
									<br> In conversation with the person representing the college, the eminent face of the council, the newly elected president of USS, Sohan Kumar Vats.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Ques.</strong> To start on a positive note, I would like to congratulate you on behalf of the whole team of Connect USS. My first and the foremost question to you sir, If we have a glimpse, the pivotal role you are playing in the administration,, how do you prioritize your work ,amongst these roles?
									<br>
									<strong>Ans.</strong> Apart from sports meet and Anugoonj, I believe that I should be able to reach and interact with the students at a personal level. I want to work for the welfare of the students. If we have a glance at the placement cell, it is not that active, so I would like to put my efforts, to make it sure that placement cell works efficiently and students get recruited through campus placements.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Ques.</strong> My obvious question to you, how do you plan to achieve it, what is the roadmap to the destination?
									<br>
									<strong>Ans.</strong> We endeavour to achieve it by organizing job fares where students can be trained for the placements. We are having a meeting with the honourable Vice chancellor sir and the placement cell to highlight this issue. We plan to achieve something good in coming 7-8 months.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Ques.</strong> My next question to you, as we all are looking forward to the much awaited event, sports meet in which various affiliated colleges would be participating, how well are you prepared?
									<br>
									<strong>Ans.</strong> My team is well equipped and ready for the event. DSW is burning the midnight oil to make the event a huge success. We have appointed 200 coordinators for the sports meet, so that the event goes smoothly. Our sports officer, Sunil Kumar sir is even working on the weekends. Apart from all this, there is an active participation of the students from the 11 schools of USS, so that they can bring accolades to USS, repeating the victorious achievement of last year.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Ques.</strong> Moving on to the clubs operating under Srijan, how will you manage to ensure active participation of students in these clubs?
									<br>
									<strong>Ans.</strong> We are trying to coordinate, we hope we would be able to find the loop holes and start working on it.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Ques.</strong> My last question to you is, apart from all this, what kind of innovation we can expect from you for the student welfare.
									<br>
									<strong>Ans.</strong> We have put up a proposal of contingency fund which would help to resolve the issues during any mishappening or emergency. I hope to help the students in every possible way.
									<br>
									<br> This was my meeting with the student president and how he plans to bring the reforms. I hope words get converted into actions and we see some positive results.
