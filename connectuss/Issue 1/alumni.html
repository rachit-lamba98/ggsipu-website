									<br> Let me start by stating the obvious, those were truly the best days of my life! College reminds me of a dialogue from the bollywood movie, Rang de basanti- college ke gate ke ander hum duniya ko chalate hai aur college ke bahar duniya humein chalati hai. I find myself lucky enough to have met all my dear friends, faculty and staff in USS. These two years have been so memorable and wonderful that none of us wanted them to end. But we had to leave with a question in mind- har mulaqaat ka anjaam judaai kyu hai? Yes, we all wanted the time to freeze so that we could live through this journey for just some more days.
									<br>
									<br> The first encounter with our jhuggi (USMC) block is a sight that we will never forget. We were surprised, actually, shocked to see what our department was going to be. We could not believe the fact that it was the place where we were expected to attend our lectures. We literally studied amidst flies and rats. To say it in plain words, it was awful. But then, it gradually became the most happening department of USS. It was we who made it lively. The time spent there is simply unforgettable.
									<br>
									<br> All unknown faces of USMC became known in no time and some of them became the best buddies who rocked USMC. Being in the main campus of GGSIPU was advantageous to us. Sports meet and Anugoonj used to be highly awaited events. It gave us an opportunity to bunk classes, that too, in a legitimate manner. Our hearts and souls were completely engaged during these events and we were least bothered about our family functions. They were no less than an international event for us. That was the charm of being in this college.
									<br>
									<br> We used to crib about everything we had. The teachers, the labs, the library, the facilities, everything was bad. But now when I think about the opportunities the college gave me it makes me feel proud. It makes me think of how fortunate I am to be a student of this college. Today, I am working with Sauv Communications, PVT, LTD as an assistant manager, media and communications. For this, I owe my utmost gratitude to my faculty, friends and college as a whole. This college gave me a chance to learn so much at each step.
									<br>
									<br> To my dear friends in college, I want to tell you guys that just enjoy every bit of college, be it studies, events, lectures etc., do not let yourself miss any opportunity of enjoyment. Every moment in college is filled up with fun, trust me.
