		  When knowledge and learning are associated solely with economics and 
		  development and &#8216;are amputated from ethics, then an overarching 
		  conception of human good and violence against humanity becomes banal. 
		  Moral choices are not always black and white, but they still have to 
		  be made.&#8217; The Education System is at a crossroad in our country. <o:p></o:p>

		<span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">
		In the initial years of its growth, the University&#8217;s prime focus was on 
		teaching of the professional courses, with a clientele of Delhi based 
		students in majority. Now after more than 15 years of its presence in 
		Delhi as an education hub, we need to gear up for the new challenges 
		such as privatisation of Higher Education, declining morale of the 
		academicians, leading to declining teaching commitments, improving the 
		quality of the scholars and their research output, balancing teaching 
		and research commitments. Individual disciplines have their own distinct 
		requirements and we cannot have narrowly laid down specifications for 
		each. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
		<span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">
		Besides, Universities should be the spaces where free dialogue and 
		exchange of ideas takes place. The purpose of a university cannot be 
		limited to providing vocational education to its students. In order to 
		make the students and faculty of the university engage with ideas of 
		higher interests, it is pertinent that they should be given orientation 
		and training for critical and independent thinking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
		<span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">
		Our University asserts its identity as a professional university, but 
		the question which comes to fore is whether professional university 
		means a disconnect from the society and national and international 
		concerns? Does this mean that traditional disciplines have no place in 
		professional programmes?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify">
		<span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">
		In the light of this, it is imperative to hold open-ended discussions, 
		with a view to prepare a blueprint for higher education in our 
		University in particular and for the higher education as a national 
		policy in general. 
		<o:p>

		<span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:
12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">
		Regular seminars, debates, Colloquium, symposia, workshops are essential 
		on such matters for we, in the University, are shaping one invaluable 
		human resource, the youth of India, tomorrow&#8217;s future for the Nation and 
		the world. Instilling a sense of professionalism with deep commitments 
		to the cause of society and humanity has to be ingrained side by side. A 
		socially sensitive individual with a strong sense of purpose and 
		self-discipline is an essential pre-requisite for a nation constantly 
		trying to strengthen its democratic traditions against the patriarchal, 
		feudal, irrational and regressive mindsets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

		<span lang="EN-IN" style="font-size:

		Keeping the above mentioned aim in mind, the Centre for Human Values and 
		Ethics proposes to organize the following activities in the year ahead. 
		Kindly also find a tentative list of Resource Persons following the 
		tentative list of activities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
