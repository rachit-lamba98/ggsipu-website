<p>In August 2009, USAP 
		started its own B.Arch. degree program at the University campus. This is 
		in addition to conducting the program for affiliated institutes. The 
		B.Arch. program of USAP is its core activity. The school is in the 
		process of developing Post Graduate and Ph.D. Programs along with active 
		consultancy and research.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Academic Program</b><br>
		The USAP usually commences its academic program in the month of August 
		every year. The duration of the B.Arch. program is 5 years.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Structure of the B.Arch. Program</b><br>
		The broad objective of the program is to impart both theoretical 
		knowledge and practical skills to students to prepare them for a 
		professional career in the field of architecture. Much of the 
		theoretical knowledge is gained in application and research mode being 
		integrated into practical / studio and seminar activity based courses. 
		The program is also designed to meet the guidelines of the Council of 
		Architecture for B.Arch. degree that meets the eligibility criteria for 
		registration with the COA as an “Architect”. The courses are divided 
		into two broad streams:</font><p>
		<b>Core Courses</b><br>
		Core Courses represent the central learning of the discipline. 
		Considering that architecture is a synthesizing discipline that 
		integrates many fields of knowledge, emphasis is given to “learning by 
		doing” or learning through application. This is reflected in the 
		structure of the broad stream stated above. The learning of 
		Architectural Design, Building Construction and Drawing and 
		Communication are principally learned in this mode. Supplementary formal 
		knowledge about technical aspects of building as well as abstract 
		aspects of architectural thought that draw upon other related 
		disciplines of humanities and the Arts, are learned in a “theory” mode.</font></p>
		<p><b>Elective 
		Courses</b><br>
		The first four years of the B.Arch. program devotes some credits in each 
		year to Elective Courses that enable students to develop specialized 
		skills or broaden their knowledge beyond the core subjects. These 
		Elective Courses also reflect diverse technical and cultural 
		developments of current relevance, and provide access to valuable 
		specialized expertise or knowledge available with the faculty of the 
		institution or in the city. These courses will be seminar or 
		practical/studio courses.
