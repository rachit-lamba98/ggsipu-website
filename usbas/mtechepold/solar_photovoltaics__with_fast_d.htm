With fast depletion of fossil fuel resources, amongst different Renewable Energy 
technologies, SPV is being looked at as a future<br>
alternative option. PV industry is getting matured and now it is poised for a 
dramatic growth and it is predicted that cost reduction through advanced 
technologies and increased production capacities will make PV to compete with 
fossil fuels in the years to come.<br>

Work by many researchers has shown that solar energy is the most effective and 
efficient job creator among all energy alternatives. An estimated 10 jobs are 
created per MW during production and about 33 jobs per MW during the process of 
installation. Wholesaling of the systems and indirect supply (for example in the 
production process) each create 3-4 jobs per MW and research adds another 1-2 
jobs per MW. By 2030, an estimated that 10 million full-time jobs would have 
been created by the development of solar power around the world. Over half of 
those would be in the installation and marketing of systems (EPIA). (Source:
